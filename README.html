  <h1>MTrace &ndash; Stack traces of memory leaks</h1>
  <h2>Compile</h2>
    <p>
      To build mtrace, just type <code>make</code>.  You need
      <code>libelf</code> (from <code>elfutils</code>).  If you're
      using RedHat you need <code>elfutils-devel</code> installed too.
      This should build <code>libmtrace.so</code>.  mtrace uses
      <code>glibc</code> specific hooks into memory allocation and
      shared libraries, so it will probably only work on Linux.
    </p>
  <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>
      Run your program, but use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to load
      <code>libmtrace.so</code>:
      <blockquote>
        <code>LD_PRELOAD=./libmtrace.so </code><var>your_program</var>
      </blockquote>
      When your program exits, a report is generated.  Alternatively you
      can generate a report manually by sending it <code>SIGUSR1</code>:
      <blockquote>
         <code>killall -USR1 </code><var>your_program</var>
      </blockquote>
      Note that the signal is not processed until the next call to
      <code>malloc</code>, so if your application is idle the report
      might not be generated immediately.
    </p>
  <h2>Output</h2>
    <p>
      The reports are written to files in the working directory and are
      named like this:
      <blockquote>
        <var>your_program</var><code>-</code><var>pid</var><code>-</code><var>seq</var><code></code>.memlog</code>
      </blockquote>
      "<var>pid</var>" is the process ID, and "<var>seq</var>"
      starts at 1 and increments each time you produce a report.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report file is a list of entries, each entry looking like this:
      <pre>
+63360
        g_realloc       (/usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0)
        g_closure_add_invalidate_notifier       (/usr/lib/libgobject-2.0.so.0)
        quick_accel_add (/usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0)
        gtk_accel_group_connect (/usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0)
        gtk_widget_add_accelerator      (/usr/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0)
        /usr/lib/libbonoboui-2.so.0
        bonobo_ui_sync_state    (/usr/lib/libbonoboui-2.so.0)
        /usr/lib/libbonoboui-2.so.0
        /usr/lib/libbonoboui-2.so.0
        /usr/lib/libbonoboui-2.so.0
</pre>
      The number (<code>+63360</code>) is the number of bytes
      allocated from the stack trace, which has the innermost function
      (the one that called <code>malloc</code>) first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entries are sorted by the number of bytes, largest first.
    </p>
  <h2>Multiple Reports</h2>
    <p>
      Using <code>SIGUSR1</code>, you can generate multiple reports
      from a single process.  When you do this, the second and
      subsequent reports are incremental.  <code>malloc</code>s since
      the last report add to the bytes for a stack trace, while
      <code>free</code>s subtract from the stack trace <emph>of the
      corresponding malloc</emph>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that you will see negative numbers in incremental reports.
    </p>
  <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
      Generally incremental reports are most useful for tracking down
      memory leaks.  The first report contains all the memory
      allocated at start up, which is usually quite a lot.  Second and
      subsequent reports show changes, which are where leaks show up
      most clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we're tracking all allocations, you have to distinguish
      between wanted memory usage and memory leaks.  The easiest way
      to do this is to take increment reports between two points where
      memory usage should be identical.
    </p>
      For example, if you're tracking down leaks in a web-browser, do
      something like this:
      <ul>
        <li>Start the browser and go to your home page.</li>
	<li>Take an incremental report and throw it away.</li>
	<li>Browse web-sites for a while.</li>
	<li>
	  Close all browser windows except one, and go back to your
	  home page.
	</li>
        <li>Take another incremental reports.</li>
      </ul>
      If you have a significant memory leak, then it'll probably be at
      the top of the second incremental report.  There will probably
      still be some "noise" in the report, e.g., because the browser
      keeps a record of the pages you've been to, or because plugins
      have been loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeating the steps above again will reduce the noise, and
      taking longer between incremental reports will make any leaks
      leak even more memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're debugging a server application, then send it the signal when
      it's idle.  Alternatively, you can put code into the application to send
      itself a signal at an appropriate point:
      <blockquote><code>kill (getpid(), SIGUSR1);</code></blockquote>
    </p>
  <h2>Tweaking</h2>
    <p>
      There's a couple of things you can tweak to make mtrace more usable.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, make sure that the programs and libraries you're
      interested in are not stripped.  That way mtrace can do much
      better at finding function names.
    </p>
    <p>
      mtrace works just fine with optimised binaries.  However,
      inlined functions won't show up on the stack trace.  Compile
      with <code>-fno-inline</code> to see them.  Sometimes you want
      them, sometimes you don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, mtrace takes stack traces 10 deep.  This can be
      adjusted by changing the <code>#define STACK_SIZE</code> in
      <code>mtrace.c</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <code>STACK_SIZE</code> is too large, then you may see many
      similar stack traces in the report file, differing only by the
      last few items on the stack trace.  In that case, decreasing
      <code>STACK_SIZE</code> will cause the items to be merged.
      Reducing <code>STACK_SIZE</code> is especially effective if you
      see both postive and negative numbers in an incremental report:
      in this case, reducing <code>STACK_SIZE</code can cause the
      positive and negative reports to cancel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the stack traces don't contain enough information, e.g., they
      only contain low-level functions that are used throughout your
      application, then increasing <code>STACK_SIZE</code> will give
      you more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have code that layers caching on top of <code>malloc</code> and
      <code>free</code>, then this can cause confusion: the leak may occur
      after memory has been recycled from the cache, but it is the original
      call to <code>malloc</code> that gets the blame.  The best thing to do at
      the moment is to disable the cache &mdash; your program might have a
      build option or a <code>#define</code> to acheive that.
    </p>
  <h2>Todo</h2>
    <p>
      Add hooks to give programatic access to <code>libmtrace.so</code>:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  Synchronous generation of reports, rather than relying on
	  signals.
        </li>
	<li>
          Let users record their own allocations, either for cached allocators,
          or for resources other than memory.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the Dwarf debug info to get line numbers, rather than just function
      names.
    </p>
